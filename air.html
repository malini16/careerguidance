<h1><center>Indian Air Force</center></h1>
<p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the air arm of the Indian armed forces. Its complement of personnel and aircraft assets ranks fourth amongst the airforces of the world. Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honoured India's aviation service during World War II with the prefix Royal. After India gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was kept and served in the name of Dominion of India. With the government's transition to a Republic in 1950, the prefix Royal was removed after only three years. </p>
<p>Since 1950 the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighboring Pakistan and one with the People's Republic of China. Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation Cactus and Operation Poomalai. The IAF's mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the IAF participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions. </p>
<p>The President of India holds the rank of Supreme Commander of the IAF As of 1 July 2017, 139,576 personnel are in service with the Indian Air Force.The Chief of Air Staff, an air chief marshal, is a four-star officer and is responsible for the bulk of operational command of the Air Force. There is never more than one serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. The rank of Marshal of the Air Force has been conferred by the President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26 January 2002 Singh became the first and so far, only five-star rank officer of the IAF. </p>

<b><u>Stations</u></b>
<p>Main article: List of Indian Air Force stations<p>
<p>Within each operational command are anywhere from nine to sixteen bases or stations, each commanded by an air commodore. A station typically has one wing and one or two squadrons assigned to it.</p><br><br> 

<b><u>Wings</u></b>

<p>A wing is a formation intermediate between a command and a squadron. It generally consists of two or three IAF squadrons and helicopter units, along with forward base support units (FBSU). FBSUs do not have or host any squadrons or helicopter units but act as transit airbases for routine operations. In times of war, they can become fully fledged air bases playing host to various squadrons. In all, about 47 wings and 19 FBSUs make up the IAF.Wings are typically commanded by an air commodore.</p><br><br>

<b><u>Squadrons and units</u></b>
<p>Squadrons are the field units and formations attached to static locations. Thus, a flying squadron or unit is a sub-unit of an air force station which carries out the primary task of the IAF. A fighter squadron consists of 18 aircraft; all fighter squadrons are headed by a commanding officer with the rank of wing commander. Some transport squadrons and helicopter units are headed by a commanding officer with the rank of group captain.</p> 
<b><u>Flights</u></b>
<p>Flights are sub-divisions of squadrons, commanded by a squadron leader. Each flight consists of two sections.</p>
<b>Sections</b>
<p>The smallest unit is the section, led by a flight lieutenant. Each section consists of three aircraft.</p> 
<p>Within this formation structure, IAF has several service branches for day-to-day operations. They are:</p>
