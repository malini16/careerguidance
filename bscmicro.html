<h1><u>Bachelor of Science in Microbiology Top Colleges, Syllabus, Scope and Salary</u></h1>
<img src="bscmicro.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="300">
<p>B.Sc. in Microbiology is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science, since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.</p>


<p>Such research at the molecular level has provided, and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.</p>

<p>The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, her<bicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.</p>
<p>Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.</p>

<p>Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.</p> 
<p>The average annual course fee in India ranges between INR 20,000 and 3 lacs, depending upon the institute offering the course. The average annual starting salary offered in India to successful graduates of the course ranges between INR 3 and 16 lacs, depending upon the candidate’s expertise in the field.</p>

<h2><u>B.Sc. in Microbiology: What is it about?</u></h2>
<p>Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.
</p>
<p>Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.</p>

<p>
In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.</p>


<h2><u>Eligibility for B.Sc. in Microbiology</u></h2>
<p>Interested aspirants for B.Sc Microbiology degree need to fulfil the below-mentioned eligibility criteria.</p>
<ul type="rectangle">
<li>Completion of Higher Secondary (10+2) level of education
<li>Physics, Chemistry and Biology as main subjects at HSC level
<li>Minimum aggregate score of 60% at the level
<li>Instead of Biology, one may even have had Zoology or Botany as one of the main subjects of study
</ul>
<h2><u>B.Sc. in Microbiology: Admission Process</u></h2>
