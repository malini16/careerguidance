<h1><center><u>Diploma in Electrical Engineering: What is it About?</u></center></h1>
<p>Engineering is an area which lays emphasis on application based subject analysis. It mostly focuses on practical application of learned concepts. It is based on the technical application of principles, concepts, and design so as to yield a desired and sustainable result.
Electrical engineering is one such specialization under the ambit of engineering which deals with the study of electrical power generation, equipment, and their design. Electrical engineers form a crucial part of trained manpower that most of the industrial firms’ house today.

A diploma course in Electrical Engineering imparts those technical skills and knowledge to the students that transform them into a trained and qualified personnel ready to be a part of industrial manpower. The course teaches various academic and practical aspects related to the domain to the students in a gradual manner.
